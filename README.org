* GPTel helpers

This repo contains two emacs helpers packages, for working with gptel.

alg-gptel-tools helpers just defines standard tools for tool use, based on the examples karthink provided.

alg-gptel-saverestore defines a function ~alg/gptel-save-context~, which inserts into the current buffer an emacs lisp form, which can you evaluate in order to restore the current context and tools selection. That form depends on ~alg/gptel-restore-context~, which will restore the context.

This works with gptel as of [2025-04-11 Fri 15:03].

If you put these subdirectories into a ~setups/~ directory in your load path, then you could install them with the following use-package declaration

#+begin_src lisp
(use-package alg-gptel-tools
  :load-path "setups/alg-gptel-tools/"
  :after gptel)

(use-package alg-gptel-saverestore
  :load-path "setups/alg-gptel-saverestore/"
  :after gptel)
#+end_src


I'm also including the original AI chat used to develop this package, for the heck of it.
